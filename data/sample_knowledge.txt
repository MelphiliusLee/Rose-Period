1. The Menstrual Cycle
The menstrual cycle is a natural process that prepares the body for pregnancy. It typically lasts 28 days, but normal cycles can range from 21 to 35 days.

Key Phases:
Menstrual Phase (Day 1–5):

This is when bleeding occurs as the uterus sheds its lining (endometrium).
The duration of menstruation is typically 3 to 7 days.
Follicular Phase (Day 1–13):

Overlaps with the menstrual phase.
Hormones (like FSH) stimulate the development of follicles in the ovaries, one of which will mature into an egg.
Ovulation Phase (Day 14):

Around the middle of the cycle, a surge in LH (Luteinizing Hormone) causes the ovary to release an egg.
This is the most fertile period, lasting about 24 hours.
Luteal Phase (Day 15–28):

After ovulation, the empty follicle forms the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone to maintain a potential pregnancy.
If pregnancy doesn’t occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, hormone levels drop, and the cycle restarts.
2. Key Hormones
Estrogen:
Helps build the uterine lining during the follicular phase.
Progesterone:
Maintains the uterine lining after ovulation.
FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone):
Stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles.
LH (Luteinizing Hormone):
Triggers ovulation.
3. Common Menstrual Symptoms
Physical Symptoms:
Abdominal cramps (dysmenorrhea)
Breast tenderness

4. Menstrual Disorders
Amenorrhea:

Absence of menstruation (primary: never started, or secondary: stopped for 3+ months).
Causes: hormonal imbalances, stress, excessive exercise, or low body weight.
Dysmenorrhea:

Painful periods caused by strong uterine contractions.
Can be treated with heat, NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen), or hormonal birth control.
Menorrhagia:

Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding.
May result from hormonal imbalances, fibroids, or clotting disorders.
Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD):

Severe form of PMS affecting daily activities.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS):

A hormonal disorder causing irregular periods, excess androgen levels, and ovarian cysts.
5. Managing Menstrual Health
Track Your Cycle:

Use apps or calendars to track the length and symptoms of your cycle.
Nutrition:

Maintain a balanced diet rich in iron (to replenish blood loss), calcium, and vitamins.
Reduce caffeine, sugar, and salt to alleviate bloating and cramps.
Exercise:

Regular physical activity can reduce cramps and improve mood.
Stay Hydrated:

Drink plenty of water to minimize bloating.
Pain Relief:

Apply heat to the abdomen or back.
Use over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen.
Consult a Doctor:

Seek medical advice for irregular periods, severe pain, or heavy bleeding.
6. Sustainable Menstrual Products
Disposable Options:
Sanitary pads and tampons (easy to use but generate waste).
Reusable Options:
Menstrual cups (e.g., DivaCup): Eco-friendly and cost-effective.
Reusable cloth pads.
Period underwear (e.g., Thinx).
7. Interesting Facts
Menstrual Synchrony:
The idea that women living together synchronize their cycles has limited scientific evidence.
First Period (Menarche):
Occurs between ages 9–15, with the global average around 12 years old.
Period Myths:
It's a myth that swimming is unsafe during menstruation.
Exercise is not harmful and can actually reduce cramps.
